# Homelab Session Summary – Raspberry Pi 5 Recovery & Services Validation

## Overview
This session focused on restoring a Raspberry Pi 5–based services node after infrastructure changes, validating network configuration, confirming container health, and re-establishing awareness of the service orchestration layer in use. The goal was to ensure the node remained stable, predictable, and aligned with long-term homelab design principles.

This work intentionally prioritized **verification and cleanup** over introducing new services.

---

## Completed Tasks

### Raspberry Pi 5 Power & Connectivity
- Powered on the Raspberry Pi 5 using a managed case with onboard power control
- Observed expected Ethernet connectivity during boot
- Identified an **unexpected Wi-Fi auto-connection**
- Disabled Wi-Fi to ensure the node operates as a wired-only server
- Confirmed system stability after boot

**Key commands used:**
```bash
nmcli device status
nmcli connection show
nmcli device disconnect wlan0
```

## Network Configuration Cleanup

- Verified current IP configuration on the Pi
- Confirmed the node had previously been configured with a static IP
- Reverted the Pi to DHCP-based addressing
- Implemented a DHCP reservation on the network gateway to retain a predictable address without host-level static configuration

**Key commands used (on the Pi):**
```
ip addr show
ip route
nmcli device show eth0
```

**Design rationale:**

- Centralized IP management
- Reduced configuration drift
- Easier future subnet or gateway changes

## Docker Health Check (Post-Downtime)

- Verified Docker daemon status
- Confirmed containers automatically started after reboot
- Validated container uptime and exposed service ports
- Reviewed Docker disk usage and reclaimable space

**Key commands used:**
```
systemctl status docker --no-pager
docker ps -a
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Image}}\t{{.Status}}"
docker system df
```

No containers were found to be crash-looping or unhealthy.

## Docker Restart & Orchestration Validation
- Observed that container restart policies were inconsistent or unset
- Confirmed containers still reliably start on reboot
- Identified a host-level orchestration layer responsible for container lifecycle management
- Validated that container availability does not depend solely on Docker restart policies

**Key commands used:**
```
docker inspect <container> | grep -i restart
docker ps -aq | xargs -I{} docker inspect -f '{{.Name}} -> {{.HostConfig.RestartPolicy.Name}}' {}
systemctl list-unit-files | grep -Ei 'docker|compose'
```


## Application Data Sync Validation

- Corrected configuration for an existing photo/media synchronization workflow
- Re-ran synchronization
- Confirmed successful transfer and stable container behavior

Service-specific commands and paths are intentionally omitted from public documentation.

## Firewall & Access Policy Review

- Audited recent network access rule changes
- Confirmed management access aligns with intended trust boundaries
- Validated connectivity only from approved internal networks

This step ensured changes made during earlier infrastructure work did not unintentionally expand access.

## Service Management UI Rediscovery

- Re-identified the host-level service management platform in use
- Confirmed it operates as system services, not as a container
- Located the management UI on a non-standard port
- Resolved an initial UI loading issue
- Successfully accessed the interface from trusted internal networks

**Key commands used:**
```
systemctl status casaos*
journalctl -u casaos-gateway -n 50 --no-pager
ss -tulnp | grep :81

```


**Key Learnings & Takeaways**
- Host-level orchestration tools may manage containers without appearing in docker ps

- Containers can reliably restart even without explicit Docker restart policies when managed externally

- DHCP with reservations provides the stability of static IPs without host-level configuration debt

- Wi-Fi should be disabled on infrastructure nodes unless explicitly required

- UI-layer issues (white screens, partial loads) are often service or cache related, not network failures

- Periodic rediscovery and documentation of “forgotten” tooling is a normal and valuable part of maintaining a mature homelab

**Current State (End of Session)**

Raspberry Pi 5: Online, stable, wired-only, DHCP with reservation

Docker: Healthy, all containers running as expected

Networking: Predictable addressing and intended access boundaries

Firewall: Policies reviewed and validated

Service Management UI: Accessible and understood

Documentation: Updated and cleaned for future reference
