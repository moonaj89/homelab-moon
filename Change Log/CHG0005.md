# Homelab Session Summary – Raspberry Pi 5 Recovery & Services Validation

## Overview
This session focused on restoring a Raspberry Pi 5–based services node after infrastructure changes, validating network configuration, confirming container health, and re-establishing awareness of the service orchestration layer in use. The goal was to ensure the node remained stable, predictable, and aligned with long-term homelab design principles.

This work intentionally prioritized **verification and cleanup** over introducing new services.

## Completed Tasks

### Raspberry Pi 5 Power & Connectivity
- Powered on the Raspberry Pi 5 using a managed case with onboard power control
- Observed expected Ethernet connectivity during boot
- Identified an **unexpected Wi-Fi auto-connection**
- Disabled Wi-Fi to ensure the node operates as a wired-only server
- Confirmed system stability after boot

**Key commands used:**
```bash
nmcli device status
nmcli connection show
nmcli device disconnect wlan0


## Network Configuration Cleanup

- Verified current IP configuration on the Pi
- Confirmed the node had previously been configured with a static IP
- Reverted the Pi to DHCP-based addressing
- Implemented a DHCP reservation on the network gateway to retain a predictable address without host-level static configuration

**Key commands used (on the Pi):**

ip addr show
ip route
nmcli device show eth0
