# Security Lab Topology

The goal of this lab is to simulate a small enterprise network with:

- Active Directory domain
- Workstation clients
- Security Onion monitoring traffic
- Controlled attack / detection scenarios

## High-Level Design

- AD domain: `lab.local`
- Domain Controller: `ad-dc01.lab.local`
- Windows client(s): `win10-lab01.lab.local`, etc.
- Security Onion:
  - Monitors SPAN / mirror ports
  - Receives logs from Windows via Winlogbeat / Sysmon
- Firewall controls egress and lateral movement between VLANs.
